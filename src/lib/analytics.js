 * buffers into dataLayer until the library arrives — so a guarded call is enough
 * and nothing is lost.
 *
 * Nothing identifying goes out. Callers pass slugs, ids and category names; no
 * email, name, date of birth or free text from an intake ever reaches here, and
 * page views are sent as pathname only. That matters more than usual on a
 * telehealth site: the page someone views is itself health-adjacent, and the
 * Consumer Health Data Privacy Notice is what discloses that collection.
